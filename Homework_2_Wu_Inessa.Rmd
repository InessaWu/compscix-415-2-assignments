This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r load_packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

#### Exercises 3.2.4
```{r }
ggplot2::mpg
```

```{r }
ggplot(data=mpg)
```
####1. I see just the graphing template, nothing plotted
```{r }
glimpse(mpg)
```
####2. 234 rows (observations); 11 columns (variables); drv is f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd
```{r}
?mpg
```
####3. drv describes how torque is provided to the wheels 
####4. 
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy))
```
####5.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = drv))
```
####graph does not make sense because it does not communicate any insights

###Exercises 3.3.1
####1. Data points are not blue because the manually set aethetic - color - needs to be set outside of aes()
####2. Categorical variables: model, year, trans, drv, fl, class; Continuous variables: despl, cyl, cty, hwy. Can look at the portion of the dataset by typing glipse(mpg)
####3. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy), color="blue")
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy, size=displ))
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy, shape=drv))
```
####Errors or warnings show up when aesthetics are mapped to categorical variables; continuous variable cannot be mapped to shape or other categoricals aesthetics
#####4.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy, color=cty, size=cty))

```
####mapping the same variable to multiple aesthetics combines and defines the output according t o both aesthetics, in this case color and size
####5. Stroke aesthetic to modify the width of the border. works with shapes 21-24 - must have fill color and border

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x = class, y = hwy, size=hwy), shape=21, fill="red", stroke=1)
```
#####6.
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x = class, y = hwy,colour = displ < 5))
```
####creates a variable and assigns color to it: in this case is displacemtnt is less than 5, it's orange
