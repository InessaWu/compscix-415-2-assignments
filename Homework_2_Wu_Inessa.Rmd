This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r load_packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r }
ggplot2::mpg
```

```{r }
ggplot(data=mpg)
```
####1. I see just the graphing template, nothing plotted
```{r }
glimpse(mpg)
```
####2. 234 rows (observations); 11 columns (variables); drv is f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd
```{r}
?mpg
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy))
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = drv))
```
####graph does nto make sense because it does not communicate any insights
